# Google-Clone

This project is a basic clone of the Google Search homepage, built using only HTML and CSS.

# Purpose

The goal of this project is to practice CSS layout and styling concepts by replicating a familiar and minimal UI. This helped reinforce my understanding of positioning, alignment, spacing, and button styling.

# Features

- Google logo displayed using an external image
- Centered search input box with rounded borders
- Two styled buttons ("Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky")
- Responsive and clean layout using flexbox and margin utilities

# Technologies Used
